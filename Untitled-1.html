<div><p>Plan today to effectively make the most of your IT investments in the coming year. Lockheed Martin Desktop Solutions, Inc. (<span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="DSI" data-scaytid="1">DSI</span>) offers a variety of options for you to effectively spend this year&rsquo;s funds to positively impact next year&rsquo;s budget.&nbsp;</p><p>As the federal budget year draws to a close, we recommend that agencies take stock of existing IT investments and consider how to leverage those investments to maximize returns, keep costs low and improve business processes while saving you money in the following year and beyond. You&rsquo;ve made the smart choice to implement IQ.&nbsp; Your users are trained, your workflows are in place and adoption is going well.&nbsp; How can you continue the momentum and really make the most of your investment?</p><p style="margin-left: 1.5pt"><strong><u>Extending the End Points</u>:</strong>&nbsp; IQ is a great tool for tracking work within your office.&nbsp; There are also a number of ways to extend that reach to your users, constituents and others who provide information pertinent to the work that you do.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Consider how data comes in:&nbsp;</p><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody>

Sometimes, something as simple as modifying or creating custom search screens, reports, dashboards and record layout can transform the IQ experience from good to great.&nbsp; A minimal investment can result in clearer, more intuitively presented data for your users and better high level understanding for your managers, compliance officers and others involved in tracking how records are processed.</p><p style="margin-left: 1.5pt"><strong><u>Training</u>:</strong>&nbsp; Advanced training, skills gap analysis, customized e-Learning modules and targeted training on adjacent features are all great ways to ensure your users are fully supported in their use of IQ.&nbsp; From the administrative side, training is available to allow you to better manage and customize IQ on your own, keeping your total cost of ownership as low as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Additional Applications</u>:</strong>&nbsp; Typically, IQ is adopted to address a specific set of workflow requirements within an organization.&nbsp; The most critical needs come first.&nbsp; But why stop there?&nbsp; Our customers use IQ for tracking everything from Congressional requests to document management, processing <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="FOIA" data-scaytid="9">FOIA</span> requests and appeals to taxicab licensing and pothole repairs.&nbsp; With a platform that is that adaptable, ask yourself and your users how else IQ could be put to use to offer structure and traceability to additional processes within your office.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Who Else</u>?</strong>&nbsp; The question sounds simple, and it is.&nbsp; Sometimes the easiest way to extend the benefits you&rsquo;re already getting from IQ is to bring IQ to more users, allowing them to benefit in the same way your early adopters have.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever your needs, we&rsquo;re here to help.&nbsp; <u>Contact</u> your Lockheed Martin <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="DSI" data-scaytid="3">DSI</span> project manager or Information Technology Consultant (ITC) to receive tools, support and guidance to ensure you continue to get the most from your IQ investment.</p></div>
